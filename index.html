        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>All was quiet, all was still...</p>
        <p>And a programmer sat alone at home...</p>
        <p>The dim light of his monitor the only thing lighting the room</p>
        <p>Working with a partner, he pushed and pulled, hoping to not reach any conflicts...</p>
        <p>Past evening into night, they pushed and pulled on and on...</p>
